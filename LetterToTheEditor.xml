    <secondparagraph>Rock climbing is difficult. So are the martial arts, free diving, and competitive word association.</secondparagraph>
    <thirdparagraph>To be frank, there aren't enough sentences in these paragraphs.</thirdparagraph>
    <fourthparagraph>Poetic license will have to prevail for now. I will work on this further as my learning continues.</fourthparagraph>
